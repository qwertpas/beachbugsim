# beachbugsim
Customize positions and types of wheels on a 2d robot, then simulate code.
- simulated encoder values
- position and velocity graphs
- easy functions to get joystick axis and button values, or automatically use the coordinates of your mouse cursor when no joystick is connected
- similar format as the real FRC program (init and execute functions, 50Hz loop time)
- mostly accurate physics and adjustable constant values (coefficients of friction, gearing, etc.)
- functions for 1D motion profiling, PID, closed loop driving
- functions for generating your own graphs for debugging
- maven for easier library adding
